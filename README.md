This project was originally started to allow opening GGUF models in Mojo lang. Since then, the Mojo and the Modular (MAX) ecosystem has come a long way.

There is native support for reading GGUF models through MAX now: https://docs.modular.com/max/api/python/graph/weights/#max.graph.weights.GGUFWeights
